IELTS Institute Homepage (React + Tailwind CSS)
1. Project Overview
This is a modern, responsive, single-page application (SPA) designed as a promotional homepage for a fictional IELTS (International English Language Testing System) training institute. The design follows a professional aesthetic with a clean white background and striking red accents, as specified by the design brief.

The entire application is contained within a single App.jsx component, demonstrating strong component-based architecture without relying on external bundling or complex build environments.

2. Features
Responsive Design: Fully optimized layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

Aesthetic: Clean white background with Red accents (text-red-600, bg-red-50).

Component Structure: Organized into logical React components: Navbar, HeroSection, FeaturesSection, TestimonialSection, and ContactSection.

Inline Icons: Uses inline SVG components instead of external icon libraries (like lucide-react) to ensure stability in the single-file development environment.

Interactive CTA: Includes a functional contact form simulation to demonstrate user interaction.

3.Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: React JS

Styling: Tailwind CSS 

Getting Started (How to Run Locally)
Since this project is designed as a single-file application for deployment environments (like a code playground or Canvas), running it locally is extremely simple.

Save the Code: Save the entire content of the provided React file (IELTSInstituteApp.jsx or similar) into a file named index.html.

Note: This assumes you are placing the JSX inside a basic HTML structure that loads React and Tailwind CDNs, or are using a compatible environment that handles this for you.

Open in Browser: Open the saved index.html file directly in your web browser.

No npm install or build steps are required!
